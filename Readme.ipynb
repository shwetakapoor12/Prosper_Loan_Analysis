    "After analyzing the variables across dataset, Borrower APR and Lender yield are directly positively correlated which is obvious as more the APR, more will be the interest and more will be lender's yield. However, CreditScoreRangeUpper and ProsperScore negatively correlated to BorrowerAPR. \n",
    "\n",
    "Scatter plot and Heatmap were also created to find out that ProsperScore and BorrowerAPR were negatively correlated as higher the prosper score lower will be the risk attached hence lower will be the APR and that further lowers down the yield.\n",

    "Multiple box plots were analyzed for variables Loan status, APR and Employment Status. We can very well see that for For each category of loan status, the lowest APR is for Employed and Full-time. Whereas highest APR is for Not employed. That means borrower APR is related to Employment status. More secure jobs get low APR and vice versa.\n",
